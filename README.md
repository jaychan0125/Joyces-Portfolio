# Joyce's Portfolio

## 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This week's challenge was to build a portfolio page from scratch! Two weeks in and we're already building from nothing?! It was honestly a bit overwhelming, I think the worst part for me was all the creative freedom: I don't design well! My favourite things are raccoons and the colour yellow... So here is my site based off of that and my newly developing skills!


My application can be navigated with a navigation bar on the top right that collapses into a column when the screen becomes smaller than 600px in width. Scrolling or clicking around, you can find out a little bit "About Me", see "Projects" I've done (and will be adding to. the filler links will just open up a new tab of this site), and a "Contact Info" section if someone would like to reach me (the phone number and email aren't mine).


One of my favourite features would be the Raccoons that appear when you hover over certain parts of the page, such as navigation links, and links to other sites. When you click on things, you'll also see an orange glow appear under, or in the case of my projects, they'll tilt the other way!


Through this project I've developed a better understanding of Flexbox and CSS positioning. Which has really helped me with the layout of my page. I've also gotten a better hang of CSS selectors and understanding parent/children inheritance. I also learned how important media queries were to responsive design and how much work it takes to make everything still look good after some simple resizing movements!

## Usage

![Joyce's Portfolio](./Assets/images/ *****ADD LINK TO SCREENSHOT OF MY PORTFOLIO*******)

The Navigation Bar on the top right has navigation buttons that will link you further down the page to the associated sections.


There are multiple links on the page. From the Project's section, the images/text will open up a new tab to the associated webpage. (placeholders will open up my Joyce's Portfolio page again)


There are also Contact Info links, where if you are on a mobile device, it will put the phone number in for you, the email link will start an email draft with the displayed email as the recipient on the user's email application of choice, and the other links will open up to their corresponding pages on a new tab.


When you hover over available links, Raccoons will appear to show you what you're looking at, and the colour of the text will change. Clicking on them will bring out an orange glow from under them


Colour change does not apply to text on project images where the images and the text are both links to their corresponding webpages; however, if you select on them, they will instead tilt the opposite direction!
